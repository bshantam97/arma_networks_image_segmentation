### Introduction to the Project 
In this research project, we aim to integrate the state of the art semantic segmentation architectures like Deeplab-v3, DeepLab v3+  and RefineNet with Auto Regressive moving average networks and test its performance on the cityscapes dataset.

### Data
The dataset used was Cityscapes dataset for the task of image segmentation(number of classes=19). The dataset can be downloaded from here: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/ 


### Software Required
To run the jupyter notebooks, use Python 3. Standard libraries like Numpy and PyTorch are used.
